Cummingtonite is a member of the cummingtonite-grunerite solid solution series which ranges from Mg7Si8O22(OH)2 for magnesiocummingtonite to the iron rich grunerite endmember Fe7Si8O22(OH)2. Cummingtonite is used to describe minerals of this formula with between 30 and 70 per cent Fe7Si8O22(OH)2. Thus, cummingtonite is the series intermediate. Manganese also substitutes for (Fe,Mg) within cummingtonite amphibole, replacing B site atoms. These minerals are found in high-grade metamorphic banded iron formation and form a compositional series between Mn2Mg5Si8O22(OH)2 (tirodite) and Mn2Fe5Si8O22(OH)2 (dannemorite). Calcium, sodium and potassium concentrations in cummingtonite are low. Cummingtonite tends toward more calcium substitution than related anthophyllite. Similarly, cummingtonite has lower ferric iron and aluminium than anthophyllite. Amosite is a rare asbestiform variety of grunerite that was mined as asbestos only in the eastern part of the Transvaal Province of South Africa. The origin of the name is Amosa, the acronym for the mining company "Asbestos Mines of South Africa.
